# Build two pandas DataFrames:
1. Spellwise
2. Championwise

# Begin Spellwise:
It is easier if I assume the champions are level 18.
Each row is a spell and has following columns:

- Name of the Champion it belongs to
- Name of the spell
- The key it is tied to (Q, W, E, R)
- Cooldown time at Level 18
- CooldownBurn at lvl 18?
- costBurn
- costType
- Description? -> Better the extended version
- Effect at lvl 18?
- Range at lvl 18


(Do extra frame for the passive)
